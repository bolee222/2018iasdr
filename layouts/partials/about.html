					<div class="about-textp"> <b>Impact Design</b> is a design approach launched by the Department of Industrial Design at KAIST as the theme of the 4th Brain Korea Initiative. This aims to bring <b>positive and sustainable impacts into our future by satisfying the desirability for human beings, viability for the organization, and technological feasibility, while at the same time resolving the problems of humankind across the society</b>. Then, as a designer as well as a design researcher, it is getting more important to answer ‘how Design can create a positive future and sustainable influence to solve current problems across society.’ And we believe this will be the starting point to make a large impact on the entire human race including science and technology, business, society, and the environment. This panel will be the journey of finding answers for this question together. </div>

					<div class="about-textp"> Especially for this year, we are focusing on Impact Design against COVID 19. We would like to introduce selected design projects and research outcomes that have been done to support pandemic and support our society. We invite panellists and participants to discuss the implications and insights on how we can strengthen the rigor of design and the relevance to the society. We will also discuss the future of the pandemic crisis and how design can make positive social impacts. We hope to share our ideas on Impact Design and share inspirations with global designers, researchers, and students on the future of Impact Design education, research and practice.</div>
